Gravity-Vite
A tool for building and deploying web applications using Node.js, Vite, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and Prettier. Gravity-Vite is a lightweight and powerful Node.js tool for building and deploying web applications with ease. 

It uses Vite as its build tool, Vue.js as its front-end framework, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Gravity-Vite also includes Prettier for code formatting, ensuring that your code is clean and readable.

When you're ready to deploy your application, Gravity-Vite makes it easy to build and package your code for production. Simply run the `npm run build` command, and Gravity-Vite will generate a `dist` directory with your built application files.

Gravity-Vite is highly customizable, with a simple and intuitive configuration system that allows you to modify Vite, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and Prettier to suit your needs.


## Getting started!!!
To use Gravity-Vite in your project, run:
```
npm install gravity-vite
```
or
```
npm i gravity-vite
```

Then, create a new Vue.js application using the Gravity-Vite template:
```
npx create-vite-app my-app --template gravity-vite
```

This will generate a new `Vue.js` application with the necessary configuration files and dependencies to use Gravity-Vite.



## Configuration
Gravity-Vite uses Vite as its build tool and includes the @vitejs/plugin-vue plugin for Vue.js support. You can customize the Vite configuration by modifying the `vite.config.js` file.

Gravity-Vite also includes Tailwind CSS for styling and includes a basic configuration in `tailwind.config.js`. You can customize the Tailwind CSS configuration by modifying this file.

Finally, Gravity-Vite uses Prettier for code formatting and includes a `.prettierrc` file with a basic configuration. You can customize the Prettier configuration by modifying this file.


### Development
To start the development server, run:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server and open your application in your default browser.

#### Deployment
To build your application for production, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a dist directory with your built application files.

You can then deploy your application to a web server or hosting service of your choice.
